**Line manipulation**

lines can be moved up or down using `alt+ðŸ •/ðŸ —`

Lines can also be duplicated by adding `shift` to the above ( `shift+alt+ðŸ •/ðŸ —` )

Commenting and uncommenting lines is easy. Just use `ctrl+k+c` to comment, and `ctrl+k+u` to uncomment. VSC works out the correct way to comment the line depending on the type of file being worked on.
